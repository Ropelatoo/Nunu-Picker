# What is Nunu Picker?
Nunu Picker is a random skin and build selector exclusively for the Champion Nunu & Willump. 

# Why I made it?
Code is 100% made in Python, the layout is made using Tkinter. The main porpoise of it is to train my Python Skills, I plan on maintaining it up to date with the recent skins from Nunu.
